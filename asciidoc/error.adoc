= Error Codes & Responses

== Groups

- `Application Errors` are caused by business Functionality, e.g. Validation of input or other context specific business errors.
- `Technical Errors` are any unexpected errors like offline service, lost connections, proxy timeouts or any other serious malfunctions.

The category can be distinguished based on the HTTP Status Code or (in case of WebSocket API) on a special Error Code.

== Scheme

When our API returns error messages, it does so in JSON format. For example, an error might look like this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "timestamp": "2017-01-01T00:00:00.000+0000",
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "2-1 Password is not valid",
  "path": "/api/v1/accounts",
  "code": "2-1",
  "trace_id": "98737228bf44af2c",
  "span_id": "8b5e95ed6672550e"
}
----

== HTTP Status Codes

In case of a REST API the Response Status Code is described in the following table:

|===
|HTTP Status Code |Description

|200
|Ok

|201
|Created

|400
|Bad Request (Application Error)

|401
|Unauthorized

|403
|Access Denied

|500
|Internal Server Error (Technical Error)

|===

== Error Codes

In addition to error text, error messages contain machine-parseable codes. While the text for an error message may change,
the codes will stay the same. The following table describes the codes which may appear when working with the API:
